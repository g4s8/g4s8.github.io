### TODO: Who I am
My name is Kirill and I'm a programmer.

### TODO: What I am doing
I've taken a part in Android, iOS, cross-platform and web (back-end) projects.

### TODO: Now

All the while I had some reservations about the way<br/>
of how applications were designed and developed.<br/>
And only now I'm starting to realize how it should be.<br/>
This books really impressed me and helped with understanding:
 - [Object Thinking by David West](https://www.amazon.com/Object-Thinking-Developer-Reference-David/dp/0735619654)
 - [Elegant Objects by Yegor Bugayenko](https://www.amazon.com/Elegant-Objects-1-Yegor-Bugayenko/dp/1519166915)
 - [Pattern Language by Christopher Alexander](https://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Language-Buildings-Construction-Environmental/dp/0195019199)

I'v started to write this blog because I'd fed to the teeth<br/>
with current Android frameowrk code and with common used popular libraries.<br/>
At the moment the major part of Android SDK looks like a procedural code<br/>
combined into classes with a data-structures presented as objects.<br/>
In addition it force us to write main application component such as:
[Activities](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/activity-lifecycle.html),
[Fragments](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/fragments.html),
[Services](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/services.html),
etc as a bunch of lifecycle-callbacks inherited from framework base classes.<br/>
They does not describe object behaviour rather they exists only
to be triggered on specific event by the system.<br/>
We need to use doubtful in OOP practices like
separated construction and initialization,
[class casting](http://www.yegor256.com/2015/04/02/class-casting-is-anti-pattern.html),
[virtual methods](http://www.javaworld.com/article/2073649/core-java/why-extends-is-evil.html)
to fit framework requirements.

It's really hard to apply object oriented principles here<br/>
but nothing is impossible.<br/>
I'm going to find OO solutions to common Android problems<br/>
and post them in this blog.<br/>
