## About blog
Hello, my name is Kirill, I'm software architect and developer.
I started this blog as Android-specific, but decided to turn it
into generic blog which is related to my work. I'm publishing interesting
ideas and notes to remember it and to share with a world. My primary
interests in IT are: architecture, infrastructure,
development and OOP, so my posts will cover these themes.

## About me
I started my career in 2013 as a programmer without any degree,
my first tasks were about Android development,
then I've worked with web back-end (Java and Spring),
also I had made cross-platform mobile applications and
native Android applications before I left a company.

I've learned a lot at this position, also I got knowledge
from books, open-source projects,
[Linux kernel](https://github.com/torvalds/linux) sources and documentation, 
from [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com)
and blogs.

Now I'm working on [Zerocracy](https://www.zerocracy.com) project,
I believe in its ideas and think that it is a feature software development, although
[our principles](https://www.zerocracy.com/toc.html) are different from traditional.
If you want to participate, just ask me in [Telegram (@kirill_g4s8)](https://t.me/kirill_g4s8)
or submit a [join form.](https://www.0crat.com/join).

Also I'm working as architect on fintech project which is based on blockchain
technology and running in a Kubernetes cluster.

Here are few books which really impressed me and helped with understanding
how to make software in a right way:
 - [Object Thinking by David West](https://www.amazon.com/Object-Thinking-Developer-Reference-David/dp/0735619654)
 - [Elegant Objects by Yegor Bugayenko](https://www.amazon.com/Elegant-Objects-1-Yegor-Bugayenko/dp/1519166915)
 - [Pattern Language by Christopher Alexander](https://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Language-Buildings-Construction-Environmental/dp/0195019199)
